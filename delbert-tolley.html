        <h1>Delbert "Papa" Newland Tolley</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Delbert was born September 14, 1899, in Cranberry, Mitchell County NC.</p>
    <p>His parents were Handy Sebastian and Mary Jane Woody Tolley.</p>
    <p>In 1917-1918 his family moved to McDowell County WV where he met his wife. They were married on November 26, 1920. Together they had four children:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Delbert Newland (1921-1964)</li>
        <li>Ruth and Cecil Crawley (1923-1987)</li>
        <li>George and Hazel Tolley (1926-1997)</li>
        <li>Christine and Victor Argabright (1929-2012)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are no birth records for him. I have however found his military draft card.</p>
